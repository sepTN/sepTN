# Hi there, I'm sepTN! ☕ 🌴

👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm from the beautiful island of Java, Indonesia, where I enjoy the scenic views and the company of fellow developers. If you ever visit, let's grab a luwak coffee and indulge in some delicious durian together! 😄

## About Me

- 🎮 Game Developer: I'm a small-time contributor to the Godot Engine project. You can check out my [contributions to Godot here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AsepTN), where I enjoy helping make this fantastic engine even better!
- 🌐 Language Enthusiast: I'm also a proud contributor to the translation of Godot Engine into Bahasa Indonesia (not my native language, my native lang is Javanese). I believe in making technology accessible to everyone.
- 💻 Website Enthusiast: Apart from my contributions to Godot, I'm currently setting up a website for the Godot Community! [Check it out here](https://godot.community) and join our vibrant community of game developers and creators.

### 🌱 Current Endeavors
